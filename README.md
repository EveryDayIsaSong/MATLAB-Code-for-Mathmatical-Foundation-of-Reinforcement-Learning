This repository contains my personal implementation of the algorithms from the book [Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning) written by Prof. Shiyu Zhao. All code in this repository is developed using **MATLAB**.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Zhao for sharing his excellent lectures on Bilibili: [【强化学习的数学原理】课程：从零开始到透彻理解](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sd4y167NS). I have benefited greatly from his teaching.

And I will continue to upload new scripts and improve the existing codebase in the future.
